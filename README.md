# MS-Module-4

# User Story
- AS A coding boot camp student
- I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
- SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

# Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
- WHEN I click the start button
- THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
- WHEN I answer a question
- THEN I am presented with another question
- WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
- THEN time is subtracted from the clock
- WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
- THEN the game is over
- WHEN the game is over
- THEN I can save my initials and score

# Work
- Created an effective and fully functioning quiz with timer
- When user clicks "Start," the quiz begins
- When user gets question wrong, time decreases
- Notify user when question is correct and wrong
- End of quiz, user can add initals to appear on the "High Score" board
- If user does not answer questions, the game ends when time runs out
